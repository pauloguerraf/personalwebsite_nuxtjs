## Overview
**Apitat치n AR** is an Augmented Reality application developed in order to augment two murals of Ecuadorian artist <a href="https://www.apitatan.com" class="font-bold text-myyellow">Apitat치n</a>. The application was developed using Unity and Vuforia, and packaged for both Android and iOS devices. The murals were set as image targets and the animations were built using frame by frame sprite animations in order to reduce the final size of the bundled application and its assets.
