## Overview

In this project, I lead development of a series of interactive applications for Museo del Pasillo in Quito, Ecuador. The central government of Ecuador was  responsible for putting together a museum dedicated to tracing the history of *pasillo* music genre in 2018. A wide range of professionals were hired to make it happen. 

The first interactive consisted of a game that exposed visitors to how *pasillo* was danced during Ecuador's colonial period. Visitors are exposed to an experience similar to a videogame where they can choose a role and try to replicate the steps given by a visual guide. A scoring system was implemented using Kinect skeleton tracking in order to match users positions to the prerecorded dancing steps. The complete experience was developed using **Unity**.

A second interactive application consisted of three multitouch screens were visitors could search a large database of *pasillo* singers, composers and audio tracks. The interface and search system were developed and implemented using **Unity** as well.

A third installation involved the videomapping of 5 antique devices and instruments related to *pasillo* music genre. **Resolume Arena** and an **Arduino**  were used to control the synchronization of all the projections part of the installation. 


The fourth and final installation required modifying and old jukebox. The idea was to offer an experience that blended the traditional way of selecting songs by pushing buttons, with a custom designed modern digital feedback system. As in karaoke, visitors could choose a song and sing along while lyrics would display on a screen in front of them. At the end of the experience they could take a picture of themselves.  The application digitally placed their favorite artist in the background of the picture and email it to the visitor. **Openframeworks** and **Arduino** were used to implement this experience.
