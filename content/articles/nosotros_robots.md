## Overview

**Nosotros Robots** is an exhibition that reflects on the challenges facing humanity with the unstoppable development of robots and the possibilities they offer to transform the future. <a href="https://www.telefonica.com.ec">Telefónica Ecuador</a> presented a selection of around 20 robots for this exhibition. Due to COVID-19, none of the engineers responsible for putting together the robots were able to travel and be physically present in the space where the exhibition was mounted. I was then contacted to, under remote assistance, become responsible for mounting all the robots for the exhibition. Most of the robots didn't need a lot of work to setup. Nonetheless, those which needed to be powered did required some troubleshooting. Luckily, most of them had an **Arduino** micro-controller under the hood. I follow my usual process to measure each of the sensors signals and fix what wasn't working either on the electronics or on the programming side.

Additionally, I took care of all the multimedia setup for the exhibition. This involved 2 video-mapping installations, continuous display of video content on 7 screens and development of 2 mobile applications : an AR application to provide additional information for some of the robots displayed on the exhibition timeline, and a second application where users could read scanned comic books that had robots as their main characters.  Both applications were developed using **Unity** and are currently in the process of being re-built as webapps using **NuxtJS** and **AR.js**

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this exhibition in particular didn't receive any visitors on site. Telefónica Ecuador offered a virtual tour through their webpage. You can take the virtual tour on the following <a target="_blank" href="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=BxxYPMUKaNW">link<a/>.
