## Overview

This was one of the first websites I ever built. It has been live for more than 8 years. It was first built using Joomla and was recently updated to WordPress. Lavawave is a tour guiding company operating in the Galapagos Islands - Ecuador. They needed a reliable website that would allow visitors to get more information about their tours, make their reservation online and get in touch easily if needed.

The current version of the website uses <a href="https://www.yootheme.com">Yootheme</a> for WordPress as its visual builder in order to allow layout and information editing by the client.
