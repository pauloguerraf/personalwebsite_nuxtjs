## Overview

This was one of the first websites I ever built. It has been live for more than 8 years. It was first built using Joomla and was recently updated to WordPress. Lavawave is a tour guiding company operating in the Galapagos Islands - Ecuador. They needed a reliable website that would allow visitors to get more information about their tours, make their reservation online and get in touch easily if needed.
