## Overview

 **MuNa - Ecuador's National Museum** reopened its doors in May 2018 after a complete renovation. I led the team behind hardware selection and software development for all the interactive installations in the new museum. A 360 cylindrical projection screen, 9 multi-touch screens and 14 video screens were part of this project.  Some interactive installations replaced multi-touch interaction with embodied interaction using either web cameras or **Kinect** skeletal tracking.

### Implementation  



**Ideum** (www.ideum.com) multi-touch screens were used to run a series of interactive applications that allowed visitors to explore content through interactive timelines, photogrammetries, games and maps.  A **VIOSO** (www.vioso.com) projection server with auto-alignment technology and 6 **EPSON** projectors were used to display a custom produced 360 video on a cylindrical screen.  **ELO** (www.elotouch.com) screens were initially used to display video content but leaving open the possibility to use their multi-touch capabilities in the future.  Video content was presented with directional audio which was achieved using directional sound domes from **Brown Innovations** (https://www.browninnovations.com/)

A mobile audio guide application and the museum's were also part of this project.

<!-- The client was very happy with the experiences developed for the exhibit, and the comments from Spain were all on the positive side. We were immediately asked to be in charge of everything regarding technology for the next exhibits to take place at Espacio Fundación Telefónica - Quito. -->
