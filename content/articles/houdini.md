## Overview

**Houdini. Las Leyes del Asombro** was the first exhibit in which I got to assist <a href="https://www.telefonica.com.ec">Telef√≥nica Ecuador</a> by leading the development of a set of interactives to reinforce the content displayed in the exhibit.

For this project I led pre-production and production of a panoramic video to be mapped on the cylindrical screen, as well as the final technology used to drive the installation. A gaming computer, together with 2 Datapath multidisplay controllers, and 8 - 3000 lumen projectors, were used for the final video mapping. A Kinect, together with a webcam were added in order to implement basic interactive activity as part of the installation.

This installation is still active and has been running without issues since January 2018.
