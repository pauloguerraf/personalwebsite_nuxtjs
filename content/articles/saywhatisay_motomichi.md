## Overview

Visitors are welcomed to stand by the lectern placed in the center of the room and speak to the microphone. As you speak, or scream if you wish, the animated faces projected onto the four balloons react to your voice and move their mouths simultaneously with yours. Seeing not just one, but a group of faces in front of you following your every word may make you feel watched or uncomfortable or alternatively feel special or important, much like having your own entourage.
