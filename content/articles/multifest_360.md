## Overview

Multifest is an annual festival dedicated to showcase augmented and virtual reality projects. It is organized in collaboration between the <a href="https://www.udla.edu.ec">Universidad de Las Américas</a> and the <a href="https://www.afquito.org.ec">Alliance Française</a> of Quito, Ecuador.  In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it had to be organized from scratch as an online event. I was asked to guide the development of an online platform where visitors could see VR and 360 content sent by artists from Ecuador and France. We had two weeks to put everything together.

We used <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a> in order to build a virtual world that visitors could explore using either the keyboard, VR headsets, or their mobile devices. They could then enter a gallery of 10 photospheres, each redirecting them to a 360 video of the selected project. **Vimeo PRO** was used to host the projects due to time and bandwidth constrains.  The platform was ready to launch with the start of the festival and received around 5k visits during the week of the event.
