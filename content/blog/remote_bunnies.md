## Overview

RemoteBunnies is a proof-of-concept design for multi-agent phenomena mapping between physical environments. RemoteBunnies relies on a sensor network and a tangible representational tool connected via an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) server. For demonstration purposes, the proposed system will be integrated to map field data of cottontail rabbits' foraging behavior onto an indoor environment.

RemoteBunnies was presented as part of my Master's thesis in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).
