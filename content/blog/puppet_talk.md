## Overview

PuppetTalk is an interactive installation that invites visitors to use their voice to control two string puppets. The installation relies on pitch to movement mapping and aims to engage visitors in playful interaction while exploring the use of voice and ambient sounds in puppetry.

We live in a time in which technology has made available new communication channels that are constantly changing the quality of social interaction in our lives. "Our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other. We'd rather text than talk" [1]. PuppetTalk turns to puppetry as a resource to engage visitors in the joy of
eye-to-eye, oral communication. The installation relies on the pitch of sound signals to trigger the movements of two puppets. One puppet reacts only to high pitch sounds, while another puppet reacts only to low pitch sounds. By having puppets respond to sound input with movements that resemble a dialogue between two people, the installation builds a
communication channel to encourage both: interactions between visitors and the installation, and interactions between visitors themselves.
