The exhibition "We Robots" displays a selection of around twenty robots that invite us to reflect on the challenges that humanity faces with the unstoppable development of these machines and the possibilities they offer to transform the future. Through NIDO Interactive, and with the remote assistance of **[Casual Robots](http://casualrobots.com)**, I was responsible for assembling, troubleshooting and fixing the exhibit's robots, as well as setting up all its multimedia content, including 2 video mapping installations.
